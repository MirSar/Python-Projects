#Python Projects
------------------------------------------------------
This is part of my course work for The Tech Academy's Software Developer
program.
For this course we created a display of sample work using Python.
These are basic projects written in Python and use various modules
such as tkinter, sqlite3, and django.

##PROJECTS
--------------------------------------------------------
* Django Checkbook App
* File Transfer App
* Phonebook App

### Django_Checkbook App
This project uses Django to create a web application that functions as a 
checkbook program. This program/app keeps track of accounts, accepts transactions,
and displays the transactions in a balance sheet table.

### File transfer App
This project allows the user to choose and transfer all .txt files from one directory
to another specified directory.  All files that are moved will be saved in a database.

### Phonebook App
This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number,
and email address in a database.  This app also allows the user to update and delete 
previously stored entries.
